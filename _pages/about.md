Welcome! I am an associate professor in University of British Columbia's School of Community and Regional Planning. Planning is a subset of public policy-making that is sensitive to matters of space and place. As such, planning is inherently interdisciplinary and focused on action. Academic research in planning engages with diverse types of knowledge and is oriented toward enabling positive and just societal change. In particular, my research and teaching expertise include:

1. Climate adaptation in cities, and building community resilience to the effects of climate change. My experience in this area spans state-led policy to grassroots participatory action research. This work has been supported by over $1M USD in US National Science Foundation (NSF) and US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) grants.

2. The integration of interdisciplinary knowledge and ways of knowing in learning, research, and regulatory contexts. In 2023, I was awarded an [NSF CAREER grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2238552&HistoricalAwards=false) to explore the development of computer models of the environment as a social-political process, and how computer models can be better managed to be useful in policy processes and incorporate evolving scientific knowledge.

In addition to my academic research and teaching, I have also worked in the following roles:

- Environmental data scientist in the agricultural technology industry
- Civil engineer focused on sustainable water infrastructure planning and design
- Public health and urbanization researcher as a Fulbright Scholar in Northeast China

I use diverse methods in my research, including: statistical analysis and machine/deep learning, environmental simulation, focus groups/interviews, content/document analysis, and action research methods. I received my PhD in City and Regional Planning from the University of Pennsylvania, MS in Environmental Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University, and my BA from Swarthmore College.

At UBC, I teach classes related to and urban analytics, research design, and community engagement.

I am currently also the Social Media Editor of the journal <i>Planning Theory and Practice.</i>
